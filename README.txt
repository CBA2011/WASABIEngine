1. Compiling
This library can be compiled as shared library (dll) using "Qt Creator" version 2.3.0 (MinGW4.4, Qt4.7.3)
under MS Windows 7. It is, however, not depending on Qt in any way.
To compile the library yourself it might be easiest to download the free "Qt SDK" and then
open the WASABIEngine.pro file.

2. Documentation
I used doxygen to compile an html documentation from the source code. It can be found in
"WASABIEngine\doxygen\html".

3. Additional information
To get additional information about WASABI, reading my PhD thesis might be helpful.
